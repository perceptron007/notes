#### Architecture of Component 

Invoice Component : Parent Component 
- Hold the list for Pending and Paid Invoices
- You click on any of the list then it opens the invoice-drawer component

Invoice Drawer Component : Responsible for Side Bar which contains a Invoice detail and along with few action buttons 
- This contain ( Mark as Paid / Mark as Unpaid / Edit Invoice Transactions )
- Should this component be responsible for Making API call for performing the given actions. 

Invoice Transaction Matching Component 
- This contains transactions list which can be used to mark new transactions as paid or edit out already marked one out.
- Input it takes a list of Invoices

#### Proposed Solution
Mark as Unpaid Flow 
- No need to initialize Transaction Matching Component 
- Just send an event from Drawer Component to Invoice component about the event happening (Mark as Unpaid Event)
- From Here just ask whether user want to go away with an event ? 
    - If yes create an API call for mark as unpaid

Mark as Edit Flow
- Initialize transaction Matching component as usual.
- Now when user confirms just do the exact same flow.
