**6 things you should always look-out for a stock**

- Stock Price means price of one share
    - Last Price Principle ?
    - Whole =  equal to some of parts
    - Market Value often called as Market Cap = number of share (Stock Outstanding) * Stock Price
    - Stock price is not the only determinant of the value of the company.
    - You should also look at the number of Stock Outstanding in order to calculate the value of the company
    - Stock price doesn't tell you the worth of the company, it only tells you at how much the stock is being trade.
