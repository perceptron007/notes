# OOPS

## Basic Principles Of OOPS

Their are 4 basic principles of OOP
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

**Data encapsulation**is the mechanism of hiding the internal data of objects from the world. All interaction with the object and its data are performed through its public methods

**Data abstraction**means that objects should provide the simplified, abstract version of their implementations. The details of their internal work usually aren't necessary for the user, so there's no need to represent them

**Inheritance**is a mechanism for defining parent-child relationships between classes. Often objects are very similar, so inheritance allows programmers to reuse common logic and at the same time introduce unique concepts into the classes.

**Polymorphism**literally means _one name and many forms,_ and it concerns the inheritance of the classes. Just as the name suggests, it allows programmers to define different logic of the same method. So, the name (or interface) stays the same, but the actions performed may be different.

## Classes
Often, many individual objects have similar characteristics. We can say these objects belong to the same**type**or**class**.
A class describes a common structure of similar objects: their fields and methods. It may be considered a template or a blueprint for similar objects. An object is an individual**instance**of a class.

## Summary
* an object-oriented program consists of a set of interacting objects;
* as a rule, the internal state of an object is hidden;
* an object may have characteristics: fields and methods;
* an object is an instance of a class (type);
* a class is a more abstract concept than an individual object; it may be considered a template or blueprint that describes the common structure of a set of similar objects.
