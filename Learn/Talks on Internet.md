## Skin in the Game | Nassim Nicholas Taleb

- Make something which can be consumed in the past in order to make it relevant in future. 
- You do better when you do things bit informally instead of doing things in a formal way.
    - Architect designs better building when they follow skills learnt from other architect rather than skills learned from books.
- There are lot of uncertainty and the world but there are lot of certain methods to deal with those uncertainties. 

**Expert Problem**
- Don't open a Restaurant Business. (Lose money slowly)
- Who decides restaurant prices ?
    - Experts (Journalist)
    - Other Restaurants
- A business judged by their peers not by the clients / real people will rot eventually.
- You should have a feedback from the reality. 
- Anything Macro is easy to bull shit.
- Don't rely on Experts who doesn't have any skin in the games.

Riot against Academia Experts. 

**Symmetry ** 
Bob Robin Trade: Absence of Symmetry 

You need to take real risk in order to signal a virtue.
Virtue without action is Bullshit
Any virtue that doesn't entail anykind of cost or sacrifice is not virtue.

**Start a business**
Its more Honorable to lose rather than not start

**Inequality**
People will be willing to accept inequality if the Richer is willing to take risk. 

Entrepreneur have skin in the game. 

Equal of Opportunity â‰  Equality of Outcome 

**Green Lumber Fallacy**
There is a trader who writes a book, how he lose 1 million business in Green Lumber business. 

You have to play the game, in order to get the game. 


#### How Trust Can Work Differently ?
 
 **Early Protocol Of Internet**
 - TCP
 - IP
 - SMTP
 - HTTP

They were free (Any one can implement them and work on them)

 The internet is a rare feat of achievement because we get humans to align for something unified and everyone is connected to the same internet all over the worlds instead of having there own separate networks (Having different Incentive Structure and Ideology).
 
 It was a byproduct of Open Source.
 
 **Evolution of Internet**
 As Web 1.0 continue to evolve lot of products were built on top of it.
 These products used underlying Web 1.0 protocols but on top of it they built proprietary technologies and protocols which can allow them to monetise them and build business over them.
 
 Few of the companies were really innovative and they kind of spread all over the internet and they gradually start becoming the gatekeepers of the internet.
 
 **Example**
 - Google
 - Apple
 - Facebook
 - Amazon

The companies above kind of become the gatekeeper to access the internet.
They were all built on top of WEB 1.0 but because of the effect of gate keeping they gradually start evolving into WEB 2.0

We are now to trust the code written by these companies, they hold access to all our data, we depend upon them on access to the internet.  

#### How should we go from Don't be Evil to Can't Be Evil

**Cryptonetworks**

Cryptonetworks enable trust and cooperation at even larger scale.
 
Web 1.0 Protocols + Cryptography + Database (Which is self policing) (Security should not be centralised so as the Control)

**Explain What is Proof Of Work**

**Bitcoin** : Decentralised Database to hold your money and transactions.

**Ethereum**: Decentralised World Computer (You can write programs on top of it.)
 - All program written on top of Ethereum are independent. 
 - Program of these kinds are open source. 
 - There behaviour is mathematically provable. 
 - You can program trust.


 
 

## Crypto, the Future and The Past

### Cooperation 
- Humans are different though they cooperate with each other. 
- All the cooperation is driven by **trust**

#### How to Build Trust ?

**Social (Past)**
- We talk and make friends

**Institutional (Present)**
- Churches, Schools and Other institution which scales trust with each other.
- It's too often the case the institution we place our trust on let us down. 

**Programmable Trust (Future)**
- It combines Social Elements and Maths and Physics.

**Social Elements**
- We trust brand, Facial Expressions, Perceived Social Status, (Its hard to scale).

**Maths and Physics**
- Trust based on Cryptography Algorithms

**Incentive Structure**
- Physical Difficulty of Forging a Currency Note, It restrains person from trying to do it because the process is hard to do. 

#### Today's Financial System
**Banks** 
- Why do we trust on Banks ?
    - Well they are backed by Social Elements (They have a track record of keeping the trust aligned)
    - They have legal incentive structure which constraint the things they can do.
