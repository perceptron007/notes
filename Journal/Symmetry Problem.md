As a society we have lot's rules and system which are product and result of those rules. 
- There are rules for killing someone.
- There are rules for hurting someone. 
- There are rules for intention of hurting someone.

But as you can see as the determinism of an event start to get vague, it's hard to put a rule over it and then act on it. So as a result we have lots of system (mallicious by nature) which in short term seems like they are not doing any damage but in long term they turn out to be pretty bad for everyone except few agents who are part of those systems. 

Now it's very hard to predict whether these agents know that in long term there actions would lead to something bad.
